              Hey, I'm Shawn. 
            </p> 
                <p>     
                      I'm supposed to be an incoming freshman at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, but right now I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere, wearing an army uniform and waking up at 6:30 AM every day. "Serving my country", they call it, but for me it's just creating Excel spreadsheets and cleaning the bathroom mindlessly, thinking about what barely-edible-menu is going to be for dinner today.
          </p>
            <p>
                More seriously, I'm currently serving in the ROK Army 35th Division as a military intelligence agent normally, and a military interpreter during training. My discharge is scheduled for May 22, 2022. If you want to learn more about my life in the army, come read my blog. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I like coding, making music, videography, playing badminton/basketball/guitar/League of Legends (and be terrible at all four), and cultivating deep, trusting relationships with people I like and trust.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also like freedom and alcohol. Turns out both aren't available in the army. Please get me out of here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, welcome. If you've read this far, and you're bored, please DM me (Instagram: @shawn.leee) about what you've had for lunch. I'm probably bored as fuck too.
